In this project we intend to show the results of crossing different data sets about teams, clubs and players, with the intention of creating a tool that is useful for teams 
to view statistics about their matches, seasons and players, as well as help them draw conclusions about possible future signings by offering configurable lists of players
according to filters such as their position, preferred foot, or even nationality, since these are factors that can define the performance of a player or a club.
